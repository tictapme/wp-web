										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The CE mark, or European Conformity mark, was established by the European Community and represents a declaration by manufacturers, importers and distributors that a given product meets a number of technical and legal requirements laid down by the European product directives.</p>

<p>Manufacturers play a crucial role in ensuring that products placed in the enlarged European Economic Area (EEA) single market comply with public safety requirements. </p>

<p>When a manufacturer wants his product to be placed on the market in the ESA, he must carry out the conformity assessment, establish the technical dossier, issue the EU declaration of conformity and thus be able to affix the CE mark on his product. </p>

<p>The CE marking is the manufacturer’s declaration that his machine or product complies with the safety, health and environmental protection requirements established by Member States of the European Union, and therefore can move freely within the European Union. </p>

<h2>How can I get the CE marking?</h2>

<p>As a manufacturer, you must follow these 6 steps to place the CE mark on your product:</p>

<ol><li>Identify the directive(s) (s) and applicable harmonised standards.</li><li>Verify specific product requirements.</li><li>Determine whether an independent conformity assessment (carried out by a notified body) is necessary.</li><li>Test the product and verify its conformity.</li><li>Prepare and keep available the required technical documentation.</li><li>Place the CE mark and prepare the EU Declaration of Conformity.</li></ol>

<p>These 6 steps may vary depending on the product, as the conformity assessment procedure varies. Manufacturers must not affix the CE mark on products which do not fall within the scope of one of the directives allowing their affixing.</p>

<p>For example, for products with higher safety risks, such as gas boilers, safety cannot be verified by the manufacturer alone. In such cases, the safety verification should be carried out by an independent organisation, specifically a notified body designated by the national authorities. </p>

<p>The manufacturer may only affix the CE mark on the product once it has been completed.</p>

<h2>What are the benefits of CE marking?</h2>

<p>It not only means complying with EU law, but also has a number of advantages. Here are some of them:</p>

<ol><li>Access to the European market: The CE marking allows products to move freely within EU Member States without additional technical restrictions or trade barriers.</li><li>Compliance with legal requirements: Obtaining the CE marking means that the manufacturer has complied with EU legal and regulatory requirements regarding the safety, health and environmental protection of its products.</li><li>Quality and safety standards: The CE marking ensures that products comply with the quality and safety standards set by the EU. This helps protect consumers and reduce the risks associated with the use of potentially dangerous or low quality products.</li><li>Competitive advantage in the market: Products bearing the CE mark are usually more attractive to buyers and can be considered more reliable and safe compared to those without the certificate.</li><li>Facilitation of international trade: CE marking is recognised and accepted in many countries outside the EU as a symbol of conformity with European standards. This simplifies the export process and facilitates international trade for European manufacturers.</li><li>Documentary simplification: Obtaining the CE marking means complying with the technical documentation and conformity requirements established by the EU. This helps manufacturers by providing a clear, standardized structure for the preparation of necessary documentation, which simplifies the process and saves time.</li></ol>

<h2>Are all products with the initials CE compliant?</h2>

<p>The China Export symbol indicates that it uses the same initials as the ESA CE marking, but in its case is not a guarantee of quality, but only indicates that the product was manufactured in China.</p>

<p>No registration, test or audit is required for the Chinese export symbol. The symbol can be used arbitrarily by Chinese manufacturers. These products do not have any risk assessment, safety assessment or quality testing.</p>

<p>It is therefore necessary to know how to differentiate them.</p>

<p>The technical documentation provides information on the <strong>design</strong>, the<strong> manufacture</strong> and the <strong>functioning</strong> of a product, and must include all the data necessary to demonstrate that the product meets the applicable requirements. </p>
<p>Machinery manufacturers should carry out a risk analysis of their machines and ensure that they meet specific standards before introducing them to the EU market.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>Manufacturers must follow certain rules to place a product on the market. </p>
<p>Therefore, the manufacturer must:
</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare technical documentation before placing the product on the market</li>
<li>Make sure to make the technical documentation available to market surveillance authorities</li>
<li>Keep the technical documentation for 10 years from the date the product is placed on the market (unless otherwise expressly stated). </li>

<li>the results of the investigations and tests carried out by the manufacturer on the components, accessories or the machine or related products to determine whether, by design or construction, it can be safely assembled and put into service. </li>
<h2>
How should information be presented?<br />
</h2>
<p>
All relevant documentation, such as instructions for use, even if it contains precise and understandable information, should be written in a easily understandable form and be available in a language that users can easily understand, as determined by the Member State concerned, takes account of technological developments and changes in user behaviour and is as up to date as possible.
</p>
<p>
Where products falling within the scope of this Regulation are placed on the market in packages containing several units, instructions and information shall accompany the smallest commercial unit available.
</p>
<p>
Instructions and other relevant documentation can be provided in a digital printable format.
</p>
<p>
However, the manufacturer must ensure that distributors can provide, at the request of the user at the time of purchase, instructions for use in paper format free of charge. The manufacturer should also consider providing contact details where the user can request instructions to be mailed.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EU declaration of conformity is a mandatory document that the manufacturer or his authorised representative must sign in order to declare that their products comply with EU requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is the Declaration of Conformity?</h2>
<p>The Declaration of Conformity involves assessing the degree of compliance with regulations, national or international technical standards and other specifications, requirements or characteristics of a product or service. It covers procedures such as sampling, testing, calibration, certification and inspection/verification. All products, machines, processes, methods, facilities, services or activities must comply with some form of technical standards or regulations.</p>
<p>Machinery manufacturers will have to check whether there are EU standards applying to their machines and ensure that they comply with them before they can be freely marketed in the EU. In many cases, harmonised standards exist and can help demonstrate compliance with EU rules.</p>
<p>By signing the declaration of conformity, the manufacturer assumes full responsibility for the compliance of his product with applicable EU law.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the information required may vary according to the applicable legislation and the type of product. And that this declaration refers exclusively to the machine in the state in which it was placed on the market, and excludes the added components and/or operations performed subsequently by the end user.</p>
<h2>Where is this document kept and how should it be?</h2>
<p>This document must accompany the equipment physically and must be written in the official language of the Member State in which the product is being marketed. It must also be translated into the language or languages required by the EU country in which the product is sold.</p>
<h2>What elements should it include?</h2>
<p>In the following list you will find the details of all necessary elements in the declaration of conformity. You can also opt for <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/EU-DECLARATION-OF-CONFORMITY.pdf">download our template</a>. In any case, the manufacturer is responsible should include the following information in the Declaration of Conformity:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<strong>business name and full address</strong> of the manufacturer and, where applicable, his authorised representative;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>name and address of the person authorised to draw up the technical dossier</strong>, which must be established in the Community;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>description and identification of the machine, including generic name, function, model, type, serial number and trade name;</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a phrase expressly declaring that the machinery complies with all the relevant provisions of this directive and, where appropriate, a similar phrase declaring conformity with other directives and/or provisions to which the machinery complies. These references must be those of the texts published in the Official Journal of the European Union;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>where applicable, <strong>name, address and identification number of the notified body which carried out the CE</strong> type examination referred to in Annex IX and the number of the EC type-examination certificate;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>where applicable, <strong>name, address and identification number of the notified body which has approved the full</strong>quality</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>where applicable, a <strong>reference to the harmonised standards </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>where applicable, reference to other standards and technical specifications used;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>the place and date of the declaration;</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>the identity and signature of the person</strong> authorised to make the declaration on behalf of the manufacturer or his authorised representative.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>aditional information (when necessary)</li>
</ul>
<p>For imported products, the importer must ensure that the product is accompanied by the declaration of conformity and must keep a copy of it for 10 years from the date of placing on the market.</p>
<p>The EU declaration of conformity must be translated into the language or languages required by the EU country in which the product is sold.</p></p>
